# Polynomial-Code
NIPS 2017

This repository provides an implementation of polynomial code, an algorithm for distributed matrix multiplication that is optimal in straggler effect mitigation. In particular, this implementation features a fast decoding algorithm in order to further demonstrate the performance gain compared to the uncoded scheme. The full design details for polynomial code can be found at https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7027-polynomial-codes-an-optimal-design-for-high-dimensional-coded-matrix-multiplication.
